E-portfolio for **OM 620 — Fall 2025**  
Student: **Brenda Raquel Laime Jalil**

This site is built with GitHub Pages using the Minimal theme.  

It includes:
- A homepage (`index.md`) with my summary, work experience, education, projects, and skills
- Links to my résumé (PDF) and a profile photo
- An assets folder for images and documents

All edits are done locally with GitHub Desktop and deployed from the `main` branch.
